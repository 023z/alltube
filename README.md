HTML GUI for youtube-dl (http://alltubedownload.net/)

Setup
=======
The only thing you need to get Alltube working is to download [youtube-dl](https://rg3.github.io/youtube-dl/):

    wget https://yt-dl.org/downloads/latest/youtube-dl

Other dependencies
=======
You need [avconv](https://libav.org/avconv.html) and [rtmpdump](http://rtmpdump.mplayerhq.hu/) in order to enable conversions.
If you don't want to enable conversions, you can use the _noconv_ branch.
